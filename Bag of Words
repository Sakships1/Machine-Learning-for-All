1.Question 1
In this quiz, I would like you to find out about a particular type of feature used in machine learning. That feature is called "bag of words".

Use the internet to research the "bag of words" Representation and then answer the following questions. A simple web search should reveal some useful information. If you don't know the answer to any question, feel free to go back and do some more research before finished the quiz.

Firstly, what type of data does "bag of words" represent?

Ans - Written Text

2.Question 2
The bag of words representation ignores the order of the words in a text

Ans - True

3.Question 3
The bag of words representation ignores the number of times a word appears in a text

Ans - False

4.Question 4
How many numbers are used to represent a piece of text

Ans - the numbers represent how many times a word is used. The basic bag of words includes a number for each word in a given text, but if you want to use it in machine 
learning you need the same number of features for every text, which means you need a number for each word in the language.


5.Question 5
What do you think are the advantages and disadvantages of bag of words?

Correct
Some advantages:

Simple, clear representation
The same number of features for each text
Words are very important to meaning, so it is an important representation
Words that appear a lot in a text have more importance

Disadvantages:

The main disadvantage is that it does not take account of word order, so it looses important aspects of meaning
It is a large representation that includes a lot of features (one for every word), most of which will be zero for a given text
It can't take account of similarity between different words (word embeddings is a solution to this)
